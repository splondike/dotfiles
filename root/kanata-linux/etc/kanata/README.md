Naming scheme for aliases

- d* prefix means 'default layer'. They tend to do some complex things (tap-hold). So xlp would be modifier left side primary. xhp is modifier homerow primary.
- l* prefix means it's mostly about moving to another layer. Rest of name is just a mnemonic for the layer.
- v* prefix means it's something to do with vim layers. The rest of the name is a mnemonic.
- m* prefix means it's something to do with mouse layers. The rest of the name is a mnemonic.
- s* prefix means it's something to do with the symbol layer. The rest of the name is a mnemonic.
